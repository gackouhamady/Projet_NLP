Is
that
the
book
you
wanted?
That
is
the
movie
I
told
you
about.
Can
you
believe
that
this
happened?
I
wonder
if
that
is
the
right
decision.
That
is
the
reason
I
didn't
attend
the
meeting.
Do
you
think
that
will
work?
I
don’t
know
if
that
is
true.
That’s
the
man
who
helped
me
yesterday.
Do
you
see
that
car
over
there?
That’s
the
place
we
visited
last
year.
I
can’t
believe
that
he
did
that!
That’s
the
restaurant
I
recommend.
Is
that
the
correct
answer?
Do
you
know
that
he
is
moving?
That
is
the
girl
who
always
helps
us.
Have
you
heard
that
news?
That’s
the
house
I
grew
up
in.
Do
you
think
that
will
be
enough?
I
heard
that
you
passed
the
test.
Is
that
the
dog
you
adopted?
That
is
the
student
who
got
the
highest
grade.
I
can’t
believe
that
they
won
the
game.
I
wonder
if
that
was
the
best
choice.
Is
that
the
road
to
the
airport?
I
didn’t
know
that
you
were
coming
today.
That
is
the
book
I’ve
been
looking
for.
Is
that
the
kind
of
shirt
you
want?
Do
you
remember
that
time
we
went
camping?
I’m
not
sure
if
that
was
the
right
move.
Do
you
think
that’s
a
good
idea?
That’s
the
car
he
just
bought.
Can
you
see
that
light
in
the
distance?
I
can’t
believe
that
they
left
without
saying
goodbye.
That’s
the
chair
I
like
the
most.
Do
you
understand
that
concept
now?
That’s
the
picture
we
took
at
the
beach.
Can
you
tell
me
if
that’s
true?
That’s
the
tree
I
planted
last
year.
I
didn’t
know
that
you
were
into
photography.
That’s
the
reason
I
didn’t
come.
I
heard
that
you
have
a
new
job.
Is
that
the
right
place
to
park?
I
can’t
believe
that
we
are
finally
here.
That’s
the
idea
I
was
talking
about.
I
think
that’s
the
solution
to
the
problem.
Do
you
think
that’s
a
good
way
to
do
it?
That’s
the
book
I
recommended
to
her.
I
didn’t
realize
that
this
would
happen.
Is
that
the
person
who
called
me
yesterday?
That’s
the
place
I’ve
always
wanted
to
visit.
Do
you
believe
that
this
is
the
answer?
Is
that
the
same
store
where
we
bought
the
jacket?
That’s
the
movie
I
watched
last
night.
Have
you
heard
that
song
before?
That’s
the
hotel
we
stayed
in
last
summer.
Can
you
explain
that
to
me
again?
I
heard
that
they
are
getting
married
soon.
Is
that
the
place
where
they
filmed
the
movie?
That’s
the
room
I
want
to
stay
in.
Can
you
see
that
sign
over
there?
I
think
that’s
the
best
decision
to
make.
That’s
the
woman
I
was
talking
about.
I
don’t
think
that’s
a
good
reason
to
quit.
Do
you
know
if
that’s
going
to
happen
tomorrow?
That’s
the
place
where
we
first
met.
Is
that
the
right
answer
to
the
question?
That’s
the
kind
of
car
I
want
to
buy.
I’m
not
sure
if
that’s
a
good
idea.
That’s
the
one
I
bought
last
week.
Have
you
seen
that
show
on
TV?
That’s
the
moment
I’ll
always
remember.
I
think
that’s
the
way
to
go.
Do
you
know
if
that
will
happen
soon?
That’s
the
project
I’ve
been
working
on.
Can
you
tell
me
where
that
is?
That’s
the
company
I
want
to
work
for.
I
don’t
know
if
that’s
what
I
expected.
Is
that
the
person
who
called
earlier?
That’s
the
problem
I
was
talking
about.
Do
you
think
that’s
a
good
plan?
I
heard
that
she
is
moving
to
Paris.
Is
that
the
book
I
need
to
read
for
class?
That’s
the
car
I’m
thinking
of
buying.
I
can’t
believe
that
they
are
still
friends.
Do
you
think
that
will
make
a
difference?
That’s
the
guy
I
met
at
the
party.
I
don’t
know
if
that’s
what
you
meant.
That’s
the
place
we
stayed
during
our
vacation.
Is
that
the
answer
you
were
looking
for?
That’s
the
reason
I
was
late
this
morning.
Can
you
believe
that
this
is
happening?
I
think
that’s
the
correct
answer.
That’s
the
house
I
used
to
live
in.
Is
that
the
phone
you
were
talking
about?
I
wonder
if
that’s
what
she
meant.
Do
you
know
that
they
are
moving?
That’s
the
job
I
want
to
apply
for.
I
didn’t
know
that
they
were
so
good
at
dancing.
That’s
the
room
where
I
practice
yoga.
Can
you
show
me
that
picture?
I
heard
that
they
are
opening
a
new
store.
Is
that
the
right
way
to
solve
this?
That’s
the
place
where
we
had
our
first
date.
Do
you
think
that’s
possible?
That’s
the
reason
I
didn’t
want
to
go.
I
can’t
believe
that
he
said
that.
Do
you
know
if
that’s
available
in
stores?
That’s
the
restaurant
we
ate
at
last
week.
Is
that
the
way
to
the
airport?
That’s
the
person
I
was
telling
you
about.
I
didn’t
know
that
you
were
interested
in
sports.
Is
that
the
kind
of
food
you
like?
That’s
the
chair
I
want
to
buy.
I
don’t
think
that’s
the
best
idea.
Do
you
know
if
that’s
a
good
place
to
visit?
That’s
the
product
I’ve
been
looking
for.
Can
you
explain
if
that’s
necessary?
That’s
the
car
I
saw
earlier.
Do
you
think
that’s
the
best
choice?
That’s
the
room
where
they
are
holding
the
meeting.
I
think
that’s
the
one
I
want
to
buy.
Is
that
the
movie
you
recommended?
That’s
the
email
I
received
this
morning.
I
didn’t
know
that
you
were
coming
today.
That’s
the
reason
I
called
you.
Is
that
the
person
you
wanted
to
meet?
That’s
the
house
I
saw
on
the
internet.
Do
you
think
that’s
going
to
happen
today?
That’s
the
way
to
the
train
station.
I
heard
that
they
moved
to
a
new
city.
Is
that
the
answer
you’re
looking
for?
That’s
the
city
I
want
to
visit.
Can
you
believe
that
they
are
leaving?
That’s
the
painting
I
saw
at
the
gallery.
I
can’t
believe
that
this
is
real.
Do
you
think
that’s
a
good
idea?
That’s
the
person
who
gave
me
this
gift.
Is
that
the
plan
you
came
up
with?
That’s
the
road
we
need
to
take.
I
didn’t
know
that
she
had
a
cat.
That’s
the
recipe
I
used
for
the
cake.
Do
you
think
that
will
make
a
difference?
That’s
the
movie
we
watched
last
night.
I
heard
that
they
are
opening
a
new
store
downtown.
That’s
the
event
I
was
talking
about.
Can
you
tell
me
if
that’s
the
correct
form?
That’s
the
kind
of
restaurant
I
like.
I
wonder
if
that’s
going
to
work.
That’s
the
beach
we
went
to
last
summer.
Is
that
the
reason
you’re
upset?
That’s
the
course
I’m
taking
next
semester.
I
don’t
know
if
that’s
the
right
decision.
Is
that
the
person
who
will
help
us?
That’s
the
book
I
found
in
the
library.
Can
you
tell
me
if
that’s
the
truth?
That’s
the
reason
why
I
couldn’t
attend.
I
didn’t
know
that
they
were
friends.
Is
that
the
restaurant
you
recommended?
That’s
the
reason
I
asked
you
to
come.
Do
you
think
that’s
going
to
be
fun?
That’s
the
school
I
graduated
from.
Can
you
believe
that
this
is
happening
now?
That’s
the
idea
I
had
in
mind.
Is
that
the
correct
address?
That’s
the
moment
I’ll
never
forget.
I
didn’t
know
that
you
were
so
talented.
That’s
the
house
I
told
you
about.
I
wonder
if
that’s
enough
for
you.
That’s
the
time
we
spent
together.
Do
you
think
that’s
going
to
happen
tomorrow?
That’s
the
project
I’m
working
on.
Can
you
explain
that
to
me?
That’s
the
person
who
owns
the
store.
Is
that
the
place
where
the
event
is
happening?
That’s
the
story
she
told
me.
I
don’t
know
if
that’s
going
to
help.
Is
that
the
company
you
work
for?
That’s
the
thing
I’ve
been
waiting
for.
I
think
that’s
the
one
I
need.
That’s
the
point
I
was
making.
Can
you
believe
that
it’s
already
over?
Is
that
the
woman
I
met
yesterday?
That’s
the
road
we
have
to
take
to
get
there.
I
heard
that
they
moved
into
a
new
house.
That’s
the
kind
of
thing
I
love.
Is
that
the
person
you
were
talking
about?
That’s
the
story
I
wanted
to
share
with
you.
Do
you
think
that’s
the
right
way
to
do
it?
That’s
the
reason
I
didn’t
go.
Can
you
explain
if
that’s
necessary?
That’s
the
building
we
need
to
find.
I
think
that’s
the
book
she’s
looking
for.
That’s
the
store
I
bought
my
shoes
from.
Can
you
tell
me
if
that’s
the
place?
That’s
the
company
I’m
interested
in.
Is
that
the
person
who
called
last
night?
That’s
the
solution
I
was
looking
for.
I
wonder
if
that’s
the
best
option.
That’s
the
answer
I
gave
them.
Can
you
believe
that’s
happening
right
now?

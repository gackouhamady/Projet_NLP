I
don’t
know
that.
I
didn’t
expect
that.
She
told
me
that.
Can
you
believe
that?
Do
you
remember
that?
He
didn’t
say
that.
I’m
not
sure
that’s
what
she
meant.
You’ll
have
to
explain
that
to
me.
I
can’t
imagine
that.
That’s
exactly
what
I
needed.
I
didn’t
know
that
existed.
She
never
mentioned
that.
I
don’t
think
that’s
the
right
choice.
I
want
to
see
that.
He
didn’t
want
that.
I
couldn’t
believe
that
was
happening.
I
don’t
think
that’s
what
he
meant.
I
forgot
that
you
were
coming.
That’s
the
point
I
was
trying
to
make.
I
didn’t
know
that
was
possible.
I
hope
that’s
not
true.
I
know
that
it’s
hard,
but
we
have
to
try.
I
didn’t
want
that
to
happen.
That’s
what
I’ve
been
trying
to
tell
you.
That’s
the
reason
I’m
here.
He
couldn’t
believe
that
happened.
I
can’t
believe
that’s
the
case.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
so
important.
It’s
hard
to
believe
that.
I
didn’t
expect
that
response.
I
was
hoping
that
would
be
the
outcome.
I
forgot
that
was
today.
That’s
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for.
I
didn’t
know
that
about
him.
I
wasn’t
expecting
that
kind
of
news.
I
didn’t
know
that
they
were
coming.
I
didn’t
expect
that
result.
You
should
know
that
by
now.
I
didn’t
know
that
was
going
to
happen.
I
hope
that’s
not
the
case.
Can
you
explain
that
to
me?
That’s
exactly
what
I
mean.
I
never
thought
that
would
be
an
issue.
I
can’t
believe
that
happened
to
you.
That’s
all
I
can
say
about
that.
I
don’t
think
that
was
what
they
wanted.
I
didn’t
expect
that
from
her.
I
wasn’t
sure
that
would
happen.
He
didn’t
expect
that
outcome.
I’m
not
sure
that’s
the
right
way
to
do
it.
I
don’t
understand
why
that’s
the
case.
I
was
hoping
that
would
change.
That’s
what
she
said.
I
didn’t
know
that
about
the
project.
I
didn’t
know
that
would
happen.
I
didn’t
realize
that
would
be
the
outcome.
He
was
surprised
by
that.
I
didn’t
think
that
would
be
necessary.
I’m
sorry
to
hear
that.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
important.
That’s
what
I’m
worried
about.
I
didn’t
expect
that
answer
from
her.
I
didn’t
expect
that
reaction.
That’s
why
I’m
here.
I
hope
that’s
what
you
wanted.
I
didn’t
know
that
existed
in
the
market.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
possible.
He
didn’t
want
that
to
happen.
I
didn’t
realize
that
you
were
coming.
That’s
why
I’m
asking
you.
That’s
exactly
what
I
wanted.
I
didn’t
know
that
was
part
of
the
plan.
I
didn’t
expect
that
reaction
from
him.
I
thought
that
was
clear.
I’m
not
sure
that’s
the
best
option.
I
don’t
think
that’s
a
good
idea.
I
didn’t
know
that
was
a
problem.
I
hope
that’s
the
truth.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
necessary.
I
can’t
imagine
that
would
work.
That’s
exactly
what
I
want.
That’s
not
what
I
was
expecting.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
right.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
a
good
idea.
I
was
hoping
that
would
be
better.
I
didn’t
know
that
could
happen.
I
wasn’t
expecting
that
outcome.
I
didn’t
know
that
they
were
related.
I’m
not
sure
that’s
possible.
I
was
hoping
that
would
be
the
case.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
what
you
meant.
I
don’t
think
that’s
going
to
work.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
happening.
I
didn’t
expect
that
kind
of
situation.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
happen.
I’m
not
sure
that’s
the
best
approach.
I
didn’t
expect
that
to
happen.
I
didn’t
know
that
was
an
option.
I
didn’t
know
that
would
affect
the
outcome.
I’m
not
sure
that’s
what
he
said.
I
didn’t
realize
that
you
were
so
talented.
I
didn’t
expect
that
level
of
performance.
I
didn’t
think
that
would
be
a
problem.
I’m
not
sure
that’s
what
he
wanted.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
how
it
would
turn
out.
I
didn’t
know
that
was
possible
in
this
case.
That’s
the
part
I
don’t
understand.
I
didn’t
know
that
was
the
reason.
I
didn’t
know
that
would
be
an
issue.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
work
out.
I
wasn’t
sure
that
was
necessary.
I
didn’t
think
that
would
be
the
right
choice.
I
didn’t
expect
that
at
all.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
important
to
them.
I
didn’t
expect
that
response
from
him.
I
didn’t
think
that
would
be
such
a
big
deal.
I
didn’t
know
that
about
the
rules.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
an
option.
I
didn’t
know
that
was
on
the
table.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
a
possibility.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
the
way
to
go.
I
didn’t
expect
that
to
be
an
issue.
I
didn’t
think
that
would
be
a
challenge.
I
don’t
know
that
he
would
want
to
help.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
happen
today.
I
didn’t
expect
that
kind
of
surprise.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
going
to
be
so
difficult.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
happen
that
way.
I
didn’t
expect
that
to
work
out
like
this.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
change.
I
didn’t
realize
that
they
were
so
involved.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
necessary
for
the
plan.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
a
realistic
goal.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
how
things
would
go.
I
didn’t
expect
that
kind
of
trouble.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
so
important
to
him.
I
didn’t
know
that
he
had
already
left.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
the
most
important
factor.
I
didn’t
know
that
would
affect
things
this
way.
I
didn’t
think
that
would
be
an
option.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
on
the
schedule.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
the
best
course
of
action.
I
didn’t
expect
that
kind
of
news.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
happen
like
this.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
be
the
outcome.
I
didn’t
think
that
would
be
a
solution.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
necessary
for
us.
I
didn’t
expect
that
to
be
an
obstacle.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
the
plan
all
along.
I
didn’t
expect
that
reaction
from
her.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
what
you
were
referring
to.
I
didn’t
expect
that
answer
from
him.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
the
right
decision.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
the
most
efficient
way
to
do
it.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
make
a
difference.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
going
to
be
the
impact.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
going
to
be
the
final
decision.
I
didn’t
expect
that
situation
to
occur.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
how
it
was
going
to
turn
out.
I
didn’t
think
that
was
the
most
logical
conclusion.
I
didn’t
realize
that
was
the
way
it
worked.
I
didn’t

kind
of
success.
I

I

I
didn’t

would
happen
so
soon.
I

about
her.
I
didn’t

that
would
matter.
I

that
would
be
such
a

I

so
quickly.
I

anything.
I

I

to
come
up.
I
didn’t

that
would
be
such
a
huge
decision.
I
didn’t

that
was
a
requirement.
I
didn’t

that
it
would
go
this
way.
I
didn’t

would
work
in
our
favor.
I

all
along.
I

I

I

I
didn’t
know
that
he
was
coming.
She
told
me
that
I
should
go.
It’s
not
that
difficult
to
understand.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
so
late.
That
is
exactly
what
I
wanted.
He’s
not
that
interested
in
the
topic.
She
wasn’t
that
upset
about
the
news.
I
didn’t
think
that
you’d
be
there.
It’s
not
that
important
right
now.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
was
going
to
rain.
It’s
not
that
cold
today.
She’s
not
that
tall.
That
seems
like
a
good
idea.
He
wasn’t
that
tired
after
the
workout.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
would
work.
It
wasn’t
that
easy
to
fix.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
that
close.
She
isn’t
that
busy
this
week.
I
can’t
believe
that
it’s
already
January.
That
doesn’t
seem
like
a
fair
deal.
He
wasn’t
that
happy
with
the
results.
She
didn’t
know
that
he
was
serious.
It’s
not
that
far
from
here.
That’s
not
really
how
I
imagined
it.
She
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
hard.
I
didn’t
expect
that
you’d
say
that.
That’s
not
exactly
what
I
meant.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
serious.
That
was
more
difficult
than
I
expected.
He
wasn’t
that
interested
in
the
idea.
It’s
not
that
big
of
a
deal.
He
didn’t
seem
that
surprised
by
the
news.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
urgent.
She
wasn’t
that
excited
about
the
trip.
It
wasn’t
that
easy
to
solve
the
problem.
That’s
exactly
what
I
was
thinking.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
could
happen
that
quickly.
It’s
not
that
much
of
an
issue.
He
didn’t
know
that
it
was
that
important.
I
don’t
think
that
she’s
that
comfortable
with
it.
She
wasn’t
that
familiar
with
the
situation.
That
sounds
like
a
good
plan.
He’s
not
that
confident
about
the
presentation.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
expensive.
It’s
not
that
easy
to
explain.
She
wasn’t
that
eager
to
join
us.
I
didn’t
expect
that
he’d
be
that
helpful.
He’s
not
that
good
at
basketball.
That
was
more
than
I
expected.
It’s
not
that
exciting
of
a
story.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
going
to
take
that
long.
That’s
not
really
necessary.
I
don’t
think
that
I’m
that
good
at
it.
She
wasn’t
that
thrilled
about
the
outcome.
He
didn’t
understand
that
it
was
that
important.
It’s
not
that
hard
to
figure
out.
She
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
strange.
It
wasn’t
that
long
ago
that
we
met.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
would
work
out
like
that.
It’s
not
that
clear
to
me.
That’s
not
exactly
how
I
would
have
done
it.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
dangerous.
She
wasn’t
that
impressed
with
the
movie.
He
didn’t
seem
that
worried
about
it.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
that
expensive.
That’s
not
something
that
I
would
do.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
easy.
It’s
not
that
exciting
to
me.
I
didn’t
expect
that
the
situation
would
turn
out
that
way.
She
wasn’t
that
keen
on
the
idea.
It’s
not
that
much
of
a
problem.
He
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
important.
That
was
more
than
I
bargained
for.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
challenging.
That’s
not
how
I
imagined
it
would
be.
It’s
not
that
obvious
to
me.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
complicated.
She
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
difficult.
It’s
not
that
big
of
a
deal
to
him.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
exciting.
He
wasn’t
that
concerned
about
the
delay.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
hard.
It’s
not
that
far
away
from
here.
That
seems
like
a
really
good
idea.
He
wasn’t
that
enthusiastic
about
the
suggestion.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
clear.
She
wasn’t
that
upset
by
the
criticism.
That’s
exactly
the
way
I
wanted
it.
It
wasn’t
that
bad
of
a
day.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
noisy.
He
didn’t
seem
that
confident
about
his
speech.
I
didn’t
know
that
he
was
that
talented.
She
wasn’t
that
into
the
idea.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
challenging.
It’s
not
that
difficult
to
understand.
She
wasn’t
that
pleased
with
the
outcome.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
was
that
much
work.
He
didn’t
seem
that
stressed
about
the
exam.
It
wasn’t
that
bad
of
a
situation.
I
didn’t
expect
that
it
would
happen
that
fast.
She
wasn’t
that
impressed
by
the
performance.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
that
far
from
here.
He
wasn’t
that
interested
in
going
to
the
event.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
much
fun.
That’s
not
what
I
expected
at
all.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
that
significant.
She
wasn’t
that
fond
of
the
idea.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
complicated.
He
didn’t
seem
that
satisfied
with
the
results.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
was
that
easy
to
do.
That’s
not
as
difficult
as
you
think.
She
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
quick.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
that
close.
It’s
not
that
good
of
a
movie.
That’s
not
something
that
I’m
interested
in.
I
didn’t
expect
that
it
would
happen
that
soon.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
important
to
her.
She
wasn’t
that
pleased
with
the
gift.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
impressive.
He
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
that
urgent.
It’s
not
that
hard
to
get
to.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
easy
for
her.
She
wasn’t
that
excited
about
the
surprise.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
was
that
significant
to
him.
That’s
not
how
I
thought
it
would
be.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
would
turn
out
that
way.
She
wasn’t
that
motivated
to
help.
It
wasn’t
that
difficult
after
all.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
big
of
a
deal.
He
wasn’t
that
sure
about
the
decision.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
noticeable.
That’s
not
what
I
meant
at
all.
She
wasn’t
that
surprised
by
the
news.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
intense.
That
was
more
than
I
expected.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
would
work
out
that
way.
It’s
not
that
complicated
to
understand.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
funny.
She
wasn’t
that
keen
on
trying
it.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
easy
to
achieve.
That’s
not
really
a
good
reason.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
would
go
that
smoothly.
She
wasn’t
that
fond
of
the
idea.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
practical.
It’s
not
that
far
from
the
office.
I
didn’t
expect
that
to
happen
that
quickly.
That
wasn’t
exactly
what
I
expected.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
turn
out
that
well.
She
wasn’t
that
interested
in
taking
the
job.
I
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
loud.
That’s
not
something
that
I
would
recommend.
He
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
impressive.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
difficult
to
solve.
It’s
not
that
easy
to
fix.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
take
that
long.
She
wasn’t
that
fond
of
the
idea
at
first.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
tricky.
He
wasn’t
that
concerned
about
the
delay.
It’s
not
that
far
from
the
station.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
enjoyable.
She
wasn’t
that
enthusiastic
about
the
change.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
simple.
He
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
challenging.
It’s
not
that
big
of
a
deal
to
me.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
strange.
She
wasn’t
that
fond
of
the
music.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
helpful.
That
doesn’t
sound
like
it’s
going
to
be
fun.
He
wasn’t
that
worried
about
the
problem.
I
didn’t
know
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
complicated.
She
wasn’t
that
hopeful
about
the
outcome.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
hard.
That’s
not
what
I
was
expecting
to
hear.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
amazing.
She
wasn’t
that
interested
in
the
book.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
take
that
long
to
get
there.
That’s
not
something
I
would
want
to
do.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
complicated.
He
wasn’t
that
certain
about
the
answer.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
important
to
them.
She
wasn’t
that
impressed
by
the
idea.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
valuable.
It’s
not
that
big
of
a
challenge.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
tiring.
That
doesn’t
seem
like
it
will
work.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
much
of
a
problem.
She
wasn’t
that
fond
of
the
decision.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
successful.
That’s
not
something
that
I
would
be
good
at.
He
didn’t
realize
that
it
was
that
important
to
me.
It’s
not
that
easy
to
make
a
decision.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
that
wonderful.
She
wasn’t
that
thrilled
about
the
news.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
fun.
He
didn’t
know
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
impactful.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
necessary.
That’s
not
as
important
as
you
think.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
easy
to
finish.
She
wasn’t
that
focused
on
the
task.
I
didn’t
think
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
rewarding.

I
know
(that)
he
is
coming
soon.
He
said
(that)
it
would
rain
today.
She
believes
(that)
it’s
the
best
option.
I
think
(that)
this
is
the
right
choice.
He
didn’t
know
(that)
she
had
left.
I
heard
(that)
you
got
a
new
job.
We
are
certain
(that)
they
will
succeed.
She
didn’t
realize
(that)
it
was
already
late.
I’m
not
sure
(that)
I
understand
the
question.
He
was
happy
(that)
you
called.
I
know
(that)
you
are
tired.
They
told
me
(that)
the
meeting
was
cancelled.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
she
won
the
prize.
Do
you
think
(that)
we
should
leave
now?
He
wondered
(that)
she
didn’t
show
up.
I
can’t
find
(that)
book
you
lent
me.
He
was
upset
(that)
you
didn’t
reply.
I’m
not
sure
(that)
he’s
coming.
They
explained
(that)
the
situation
had
changed.
I
heard
(that)
they’re
moving
to
a
new
place.
She
assumed
(that)
you
would
agree.
It’s
obvious
(that)
we
need
more
time.
I
wish
(that)
I
could
help
you.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
it
would
be
so
difficult.
He
forgot
(that)
we
had
a
meeting
today.
It
seems
(that)
they’re
doing
fine.
She
thought
(that)
the
test
was
easy.
He
expected
(that)
the
project
would
be
finished
by
now.
I
wonder
(that)
nobody
told
me
about
it.
I
can’t
imagine
(that)
she
would
do
such
a
thing.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
I
was
late.
They
promised
(that)
they
would
help
us.
I
believe
(that)
this
is
the
best
solution.
I
know
(that)
it’s
going
to
be
hard.
We
should
tell
her
(that)
we’re
leaving.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
he
didn’t
notice.
She
was
upset
(that)
I
didn’t
attend
her
party.
I
don’t
think
(that)
they’ll
agree
with
us.
We
should
consider
(that)
they
might
be
right.
I’m
afraid
(that)
I
forgot
to
bring
it.
I
thought
(that)
you
were
joking.
She
didn’t
think
(that)
he
would
be
so
upset.
I
hope
(that)
you
understand
my
point.
We
believe
(that)
he’s
the
right
person
for
the
job.
I’m
sure
(that)
she’ll
be
happy
to
help.
He
expected
(that)
the
traffic
would
be
bad.
I’m
not
convinced
(that)
this
is
a
good
idea.
I
don’t
understand
(that)
she
left
without
saying
goodbye.
It’s
clear
(that)
we
need
to
act
quickly.
They
think
(that)
the
project
will
be
finished
soon.
She
suggested
(that)
we
take
a
break.
I
assumed
(that)
you
would
know.
It’s
evident
(that)
he’s
telling
the
truth.
He
felt
(that)
he
could
have
done
better.
I
realize
(that)
we’ve
been
talking
for
hours.
I
didn’t
notice
(that)
it
was
raining.
It’s
surprising
(that)
they
haven’t
responded
yet.
They
explained
(that)
the
results
were
inconclusive.
I
heard
(that)
you
were
looking
for
me.
It’s
obvious
(that)
she’s
very
talented.
I’m
certain
(that)
you’ll
do
great.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
she
would
react
like
that.
She
wondered
(that)
he
hadn’t
replied
to
her
message.
I
believe
(that)
we
should
leave
now.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
he
was
so
busy.
He
mentioned
(that)
he
would
be
out
of
town.
I
feel
(that)
we
should
go
now.
She
seemed
(that)
she
was
ready
to
leave.
They
realized
(that)
they
had
forgotten
the
tickets.
I
didn’t
know
(that)
you
were
coming
to
the
party.
He
was
surprised
(that)
she
didn’t
know
about
it.
I
think
(that)
we
should
stay
here
for
now.
He
admitted
(that)
he
didn’t
know
how
to
do
it.
I
forgot
(that)
I
had
an
appointment
this
afternoon.
We
all
knew
(that)
she
was
going
to
win.
They
said
(that)
they
would
arrive
at
8
PM.
I
hope
(that)
they
find
what
they
are
looking
for.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
it
was
this
late.
He
was
surprised
(that)
I
had
already
finished.
She
suggested
(that)
we
go
for
a
walk.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
you
didn’t
tell
me.
He
asked
(that)
I
keep
him
updated.
I
felt
(that)
the
meeting
went
well.
We
thought
(that)
she
was
joking.
I
don’t
understand
(that)
you
didn’t
know
about
the
change.
I
wonder
(that)
he
didn’t
answer
the
call.
It’s
hard
to
believe
(that)
she
could
have
said
that.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
you
would
be
so
busy.
I
didn’t
know
(that)
he
was
so
talented.
We
figured
(that)
it
would
be
difficult.
He
was
disappointed
(that)
she
couldn’t
make
it.
I’m
not
sure
(that)
he
will
accept
the
invitation.
I
was
surprised
(that)
he
agreed
so
easily.
We
didn’t
expect
(that)
she
would
finish
so
soon.
I
don’t
know
(that)
she
was
in
charge
of
this.
He
was
shocked
(that)
she
didn’t
remember.
I
was
told
(that)
they
have
changed
the
schedule.
I
can’t
imagine
(that)
you
didn’t
understand.
We
thought
(that)
it
was
obvious.
I
hope
(that)
he
doesn’t
mind.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
she
had
left
already.
It’s
strange
(that)
they
didn’t
invite
me.
I
heard
(that)
the
restaurant
was
closing.
I
assume
(that)
you’ve
already
heard
the
news.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
we
were
out
of
time.
He
told
me
(that)
he
would
be
back
soon.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
he
would
come
today.
I
wasn’t
sure
(that)
he
was
going
to
show
up.
They
said
(that)
they
would
send
the
documents
by
email.
She
suggested
(that)
we
go
to
the
beach
tomorrow.
He
promised
(that)
he
would
finish
the
task
by
the
end
of
the
day.
I
wonder
(that)
she
didn’t
notice
the
mistake.
It’s
hard
to
believe
(that)
they
finished
the
project
so
quickly.
I
didn’t
know
(that)
she
was
interested
in
art.
I
think
(that)
we
should
reconsider
our
decision.
I’m
sure
(that)
he
will
be
on
time.
He
said
(that)
he
couldn’t
attend
the
meeting.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
they
had
already
left.
I
wish
(that)
I
had
known
about
the
event
earlier.
I’m
certain
(that)
we
will
find
a
solution.
I
was
shocked
(that)
she
didn’t
recognize
me.
He
mentioned
(that)
he
was
traveling
abroad.
I
didn’t
think
(that)
it
was
possible.
They
told
me
(that)
they
were
happy
with
the
results.
She
wondered
(that)
you
hadn’t
called
her
yet.
I
assume
(that)
they
will
be
here
soon.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
it’s
already
December.
I
don’t
understand
(that)
you
didn’t
know
the
answer.
I
was
told
(that)
the
meeting
was
moved.
It’s
surprising
(that)
he
didn’t
get
the
job.
I
wonder
(that)
she
hasn’t
finished
yet.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
they
had
arrived
already.
I
heard
(that)
the
concert
was
amazing.
I’m
not
sure
(that)
I
can
help
you.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
you
would
be
this
late.
I
thought
(that)
you
would
call.
I
didn’t
notice
(that)
the
light
was
on.
It’s
clear
(that)
he’s
not
interested.
I
don’t
think
(that)
she
likes
him.
I
feel
(that)
we
should
be
careful.
I
didn’t
know
(that)
you
were
so
busy.
They
mentioned
(that)
it
was
a
great
opportunity.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
they
made
it
to
the
finals.
She
was
surprised
(that)
I
didn’t
know
about
it.
I
wonder
(that)
they
didn’t
invite
you.
It’s
evident
(that)
she’s
been
working
hard.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
you
had
already
gone.
We
should
try
(that)
approach.
He
said
(that)
he
would
call
back
later.
I
hope
(that)
she
likes
the
gift.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
it
would
be
so
cold.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
we
won
the
competition.
She
told
me
(that)
I
should
be
careful.
I
was
told
(that)
he
passed
the
exam.
I
heard
(that)
you’re
moving
to
a
new
place.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
you
forgot
about
our
meeting.
I
didn’t
know
(that)
it
was
a
surprise
party.
I
was
told
(that)
they
were
looking
for
a
new
manager.
I
assumed
(that)
she
had
already
left.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
we
were
talking
for
so
long.
I
think
(that)
this
solution
will
work.
He
said
(that)
it
would
be
hard
to
get
the
tickets.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
you
would
say
that.
I’m
sure
(that)
they
will
approve
the
project.
I
think
(that)
we
should
continue
with
this
plan.
I
was
shocked
(that)
she
didn’t
apologize.
He
didn’t
realize
(that)
it
was
already
10
PM.
It’s
surprising
(that)
they
didn’t
finish
it
on
time.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
the
train
had
left.
I’m
not
sure
(that)
this
is
the
right
choice.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
you
knew
about
this.
He
was
surprised
(that)
we
already
knew.
I
assumed
(that)
you
had
seen
the
email.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
she
would
react
like
that.
They
told
me
(that)
they
would
pay
next
week.
I
was
shocked
(that)
they
didn’t
approve
it.
I
can’t
believe
(that)
you
did
that.
I
didn’t
think
(that)
it
would
be
this
easy.
He
was
surprised
(that)
she
didn’t
come.
I
didn’t
know
(that)
he
had
finished.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
it
was
so
expensive.
I
heard
(that)
the
company
is
hiring.
I’m
sure
(that)
we’ll
make
it
in
time.
I
was
told
(that)
she
was
really
kind.
He
said
(that)
he
would
be
here
in
a
minute.
I
didn’t
expect
(that)
they
would
be
so
late.
She
didn’t
believe
(that)
it
would
work.
I
assumed
(that)
you
would
know
the
answer.
I
think
(that)
he’s
the
right
person
for
the
job.
I
hope
(that)
everything
goes
smoothly.
They
mentioned
(that)
they
were
looking
forward
to
it.
I
didn’t
know
(that)
she
was
pregnant.
He
was
excited
(that)
they
agreed
to
collaborate.
I
thought
(that)
we
had
more
time.
She
said
(that)
she
would
get
back
to
me
soon.
I
didn’t
realize
(that)
it
was
so
serious.
He
mentioned
(that)
he
was
leaving
tomorrow.
I
didn’t
think
(that)
we
would
finish
this
early.
I
heard
(that)
they’re
getting
married
next
month.
He
promised
(that)
he
would
help
me.

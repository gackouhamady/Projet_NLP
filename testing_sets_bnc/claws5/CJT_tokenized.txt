I
believe
that
everything
will
be
fine.
She
told
me
that
she
was
leaving
tomorrow.
I
am
certain
that
they
will
arrive
soon.
He
said
that
he
couldn’t
make
it
to
the
meeting.
We
know
that
the
project
is
important.
I
forgot
that
it
was
your
birthday
yesterday.
They
announced
that
the
event
would
be
postponed.
She
explained
that
the
train
had
been
delayed.
I
hope
that
this
will
be
the
solution
we
need.
He
insisted
that
we
should
wait
for
the
others.
I
think
that
the
weather
will
improve
soon.
They
warned
that
the
road
was
closed
ahead.
It’s
clear
that
we
have
made
progress.
She
asked
that
we
meet
at
5
p.m.
I’m
afraid
that
they
might
not
understand.
He
promised
that
he
would
finish
the
work
on
time.
I
remember
that
she
told
me
about
her
plans.
It’s
obvious
that
the
team
is
ready
for
the
challenge.
We
are
sure
that
they
will
succeed
in
their
mission.
I
heard
that
you
are
moving
to
another
city.
He
knew
that
he
would
have
to
work
late.
She
mentioned
that
the
report
was
due
next
week.
We
discovered
that
the
system
had
a
flaw.
I’ve
heard
that
the
movie
is
really
good.
They
assured
us
that
the
problem
would
be
solved.
She
confirmed
that
she
would
be
attending
the
meeting.
I
was
told
that
you
were
looking
for
me.
I
didn’t
realize
that
you
were
coming
today.
We
found
out
that
the
company
had
filed
for
bankruptcy.
He
explained
that
the
decision
was
final.
I
am
confident
that
you
will
do
well
in
the
exam.
They
said
that
they
would
be
taking
a
break
soon.
I
hope
that
this
news
will
make
you
happy.
He
pointed
out
that
the
task
was
more
difficult
than
expected.
We
heard
that
there
would
be
a
change
in
the
schedule.
I
know
that
you
are
busy,
but
I
need
your
help.
She
mentioned
that
the
deadline
had
been
extended.
I
understand
that
you’ve
been
having
a
rough
time.
He
admitted
that
he
had
made
a
mistake.
I’m
certain
that
the
team
will
win
the
championship.
We
all
agreed
that
the
new
proposal
was
a
good
idea.
They
suggested
that
we
should
try
a
different
approach.
I
thought
that
you
were
going
to
call
me
yesterday.
She
assured
me
that
everything
was
under
control.
I
realize
that
this
might
be
difficult
for
you.
He
warned
that
there
would
be
consequences
for
not
following
the
rules.
I
knew
that
they
would
be
disappointed.
They
announced
that
the
store
would
open
at
9
a.m.
I’ve
noticed
that
you’ve
been
more
cheerful
lately.
She
told
me
that
she
had
already
spoken
to
him.
I’m
sure
that
we
will
find
a
way
to
solve
this
problem.
He
claimed
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
situation.
They
believed
that
the
project
would
be
completed
by
the
end
of
the
year.
I
was
informed
that
the
meeting
was
postponed.
She
realized
that
she
had
left
her
keys
at
home.
I
know
that
they
will
appreciate
your
help.
We
observed
that
the
weather
had
become
much
colder.
He
explained
that
the
procedure
was
simple.
I
am
convinced
that
they
will
be
able
to
handle
the
challenge.
I
heard
that
you
got
a
new
job.
Congratulations!
We
found
out
that
the
event
had
been
canceled.
She
assumed
that
he
would
be
on
time.
I
believe
that
this
decision
will
benefit
everyone.
He
pointed
out
that
the
task
was
not
as
difficult
as
it
seemed.
They
promised
that
they
would
send
the
documents
by
the
end
of
the
day.
I
knew
that
they
were
going

announce
the
results
soon.
She
acknowledged
that
she
had
made
an
error
in
judgment.
We
agreed
that
the
meeting
should
be
rescheduled.
I
heard
that
the
restaurant
is
closing
down.
He
informed
me
that
he
would
not
be
attending
the
party.
I’ve
realized
that
you
were
right
all
along.
We
learned
that
the
project
was
a
huge
success.
She
said
that
she
would
call
me
later.
I
know
that
we
can
count
on
them
to
help
us.
He
mentioned
that
they
were
working
on
a
new
version
of
the
software.
I
am
confident
that
the
new
plan
will
work.
They
announced
that
there
would
be
a
special
guest
at
the
event.
I
was
told
that
the
movie
was
a
huge
hit.
She
confirmed
that
she
would
be
able
to
attend
the
event.
We
found
that
the
system
was
not
functioning
properly.
He
reminded
me
that

been
informed
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
plans.
He
said
that
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
vacation.
We
realized
that
we
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
calculations.
I
heard
that
they
were
planning
to
go
on
a
trip
next
month.
They
informed
us
that
there
would
be
an
emergency
drill
tomorrow.
He
reminded
us
that
the
presentation
had
to
be
ready
by
Friday.
She
asked
that
we
be
more
careful
in
the
future.
We
observed
that
they
had
already
completed
the
task.
I’m
sure
that
you’ll
find
this
information
useful.
He
told
me
that

project.
She
said
that
she
had
a
great
time
at
the
event.
I
understand
that
this
may
be
a
bit
confusing.
They
suggested
that
we
take
a
different
route
to
avoid
traffic.
I
realized
that
I
had
forgotten
to
bring
my
notes.
I
hope

suggestion
will
help
improve
the
situation.

problem
would

I’m
sure
that
everything
will
work
out
in
the
end.
They
announced
that
the
concert
tickets
were
sold
out.
She
explained
that
the

had
changed
recently.
I’ve
heard
that

offering
discounts
for
early
registrations.
I
realized
that
I
had
left
my
phone
at
home.

help
me
with
the

I
think
that
this

method
will
be
much
more
efficient.

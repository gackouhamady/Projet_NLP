That
was
an
amazing
performance.
I
can’t
believe
that
he
won
the
competition.
She
was
happy
that
everything
went
according
to
plan.
He
didn’t
realize
that
he
had
forgotten
his
keys.
I’m
sure
that
she
will
be
successful
in
her
career.
It’s
clear
that
they
made
a
good
decision.
That
was
the
best
concert
I’ve
ever
been
to.
I
didn’t
know
that
she
was
moving
to
another
city.
It’s
unfortunate
that
they
couldn’t
attend
the
meeting.
That
was
exactly
what
I
needed.
I’m
sorry
that
I
couldn’t
make
it
to
your
party.
She
was
surprised
that
I
remembered
her
birthday.
That
was
a
risky
move,
but
it
paid
off.
I’m
glad
that
you
like
my
idea.
It’s
disappointing
that
the
event
was
cancelled.
I’m
thrilled
that
we
finally
finished
the
project.
That
was
a
tough
decision,
but
I
think
it
was
the
right
one.
I
didn’t
expect
that
he
would
react
like
that.
It’s
amazing
that
they
managed
to
finish
the
task
ahead
of
time.
She
was
upset
that
she
missed
the
opportunity.
That
was
an
impressive
achievement.
I’m
not
sure
that
we
can
finish
on
time.
I’m
happy
that
you
found
the
information
helpful.
That
was
an
unforgettable
experience.
She
was
relieved
that
everything
worked
out
well.
I’m
excited
that
we’re
going
on
a
trip
together.
It’s
hard
to
believe
that
they
were
able
to
do
it.
I’m
proud
that
you
accomplished
your
goal.
That
was
an
important
moment
in
history.
I
didn’t
realize
that
you
were
so
passionate
about
this.
That
was
an
incredible
performance
by
the
team.
I’m
sorry
that
I
didn’t
tell
you
about
it
sooner.
She
was
glad
that
she
could
help.
That
was
a
great
opportunity
for
growth.
I’m
pleased
that
the
results
were
positive.
It’s
good
that
we’ve
reached
an
agreement.
I’m
relieved
that
the
issue
was
resolved.
That
was
a
wise
decision.
I’m
not
sure
that
this
is
the
right
approach.
It’s
surprising
that
she
finished
the
project
so
quickly.
That
was
a
great
way
to
spend
the
afternoon.
I’m
sorry
that
I
missed
your
call
earlier.
I
can’t
believe
that
she
managed
to
do
it
all
by
herself.
That
was
a
memorable
day
for
all
of
us.
It’s
unfortunate
that
he
had
to
leave
so
soon.
I
didn’t
expect
that
we
would
face
so
many
challenges.
That
was
an
unexpected
turn
of
events.
I’m
grateful
that
you
helped
me
with
the
task.
It’s
wonderful
that
you’re
feeling
better
now.
That
was
a
fantastic
idea!
I’m
happy
that
you
found
the
solution.
That
was
an
excellent
choice,
I
must
say.
I’m
pleased
that
everything
worked
out
in
the
end.
It’s
surprising
that
they
were
able
to
finish
so
quickly.
That
was
a
tough
situation,
but
we
got
through
it.
I’m
glad
that
we
could
come
to
an
agreement.
That
was
a
good
decision
on
your
part.
I’m
thrilled
that
you’re
joining
the
team.
That
was
a
challenging
task,
but
you
did
well.
I’m
happy
that
you
enjoyed
the
event.
That
was
a
really
helpful
suggestion.
I
didn’t
know
that
you
were
interested
in
that.
That
was
a
great
learning
experience
for
everyone
involved.
I’m
impressed
that
they
managed
to
solve
the
problem.
It’s
unfortunate
that
the
meeting
was
postponed.
That
was
a
great
opportunity
to
learn
new
skills.
I’m
glad
that
we
are
finally
making
progress.
That
was
a
very
thoughtful
gesture.
I
didn’t
expect
that
you
would
be
so
supportive.
That
was
an
unexpected
surprise!
I’m
grateful
that
you
took
the
time
to
help
me.
It’s
good
that
the
weather
is
finally
improving.
That
was
a
productive
meeting,
wasn’t
it?
I’m
pleased
that
you
could
attend
the
event.
That
was
a
beautiful
sunset.
I
can’t
believe
that
she
finished
the
race
in
first
place.
That
was
a
great
presentation.
I’m
sorry
that
I
wasn’t
able
to
participate.
It’s
nice
that
you’re
feeling
better
now.
That
was
a
very
successful
campaign.
I’m
excited
that
we’re
working
together
on

recommendation.
I
didn’t
know
that
he
was
such
a
talented
musician.
That
was
a
fantastic
idea
you
had!
I’m
thrilled
that
you’re
feeling
better.
That
was
a
successful
collaboration.
I’m

to
overcome
the
challenge.
That
was
a

gift
you
gave
me.
I’m
glad

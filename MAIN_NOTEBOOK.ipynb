    "## 1. TreeTagger for POS-tagging\n",
    "*TreeTagger* is a linguistic annotation tool that uses a probabilistic model to predict the POS categories of words in a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installation of TreeTagger**\n",
    "   - Download and install *TreeTagger* by following the instructions on the official website: [TreeTagger](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/).\n",
    "   - Ensure that Java and Perl are installed on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execution of TreeTagger**\n",
    "   - Use test files to analyze the different realizations of *that*. For instance, in *BNC.par* or *Penn.par*, the word *that* should be tagged according to its specific role:\n",
    "     - As an adverb (RB),\n",
    "     - As a relative pronoun (WPR), or\n",
    "     - As a conjunction (CJT).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing Different Configurations**\n",
    "   - Test various *TreeTagger* configurations with distinct parameter files to observe the precision of annotations obtained.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ./tree-tagger English.par textfile.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - Replace `English.par` with the desired parameter file (e.g., `penn.par` or `bnc.par`).\n",
    "     - **Precision**: Compare the precision of each realization based on different test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare Penn and BNC Models** (Bonus)\n",
    "   - Using *penn.par* and *bnc.par* parameter files, compare *TreeTagger*'s performance in annotating *that* in various contexts.\n",
    "     - **Penn Model**: [Penn Treebank Tagset](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html)\n",
    "     - **BNC Model**: [BNC Tagset](http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws5tags.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output:\n",
    "- Precision of annotated realizations for each category: Adverb (RB), Conjunction (CJT), Relative Pronoun (WPR)."

    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Retrain *TreeTagger* with a specific tagset to distinguish the various uses of the word *that* in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select a Tagset**\n",
    "   - Use the **C8** tagset (adapted from CLAWS8) for more precise annotation of *that*. The tagset includes categories such as:\n",
    "     - `WPR`: Relative Pronoun (e.g., *The man that I saw*),\n",
    "     - `CST`: Subordinating Conjunction (e.g., *The fact that*),\n",
    "     - `CJT`: Conjunction for verbs (e.g., *I think that*),\n",
    "     - `DT`: Singular Determiner (e.g., *that* in *that man*),\n",
    "     - `RB`: Adverb (e.g., *It's not that difficult*).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrain TreeTagger with New Tags**\n",
    "   - Adapt the training model using sentences annotated with the C8 tagset.\n",
    "   - To retrain *TreeTagger*, use the following command:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ./tree-tagger train model.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measure Precision and Recall**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the precision and recall of the retrained model by testing it on specific datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C8 Tagset:\n",
    "- Refer to this document for more details about the C8 tagset: [C8 Tagset](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws8tags.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output:\n",
    "- Precision and recall report for each use of the word *that* in test datasets.\n"
